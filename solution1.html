    <!-- Internal CSS -->
    <style>
        h1 {
            color: red;
        }

        p {
            color: rgb(8, 17, 146)
        }
    </style>

</head>

<body>
    <!-- Inline css -->
    <h1 style="color: orangered;">This is Main Heading</h1>
    <div>
        <p>This is paragraph</p>
        <p>This is second paragraph</p>
        <p>This is third paragraph</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Note: I have applied different style css on same element i.e h1, but we can see that the priority is given to inline element first. It means inline css given more importance as compared to both internal and extenal css.
     inline > internal > external -->
